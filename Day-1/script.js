// Variables : are the container to store data or value
// In Javascript there are 4 ways of defining or creating a variable

/*
1. Automatically
2. using var keyword
3. using let keyword
4. using const keyword
*/
// Automatically creating the variable however it is worst practice to follow
// value1 = 100;
// console.log(value1);

// var -- 1995 to 2015 it is also not preferred to create variable using var...
// var a = "chandan";
// console.log(a)


// let and const - 2015 since then we must use const and let
let x = "Javascript"
console.log(x);

//const - const value cannot changed.. in program if you dont want change the value at any point of time you should use const other wise let...
const value = "2nd session"
console.log(value);
